        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Kouichi Cedric Gersava, but you can call me KC or Kouichi. I am 18 years old and currently reside in Pasig City. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Rizal Technological University. My academic journey has been enriching, and I’m excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in the tech field. One of my key strengths is my strong work ethic; I am dedicated to completing tasks efficiently and on time. However, I recognize that I have areas to improve, particularly my presentation skills. While I feel comfortable communicating with individuals or small groups, I tend to get nervous when presenting to larger audiences. Nonetheless, I am committed to overcoming this challenge to enhance my overall communication abilities. In addition to my work ethic, I possess several valuable skills, including adaptability and time management. I can quickly adjust to new environments and situations, which has helped me thrive in various academic and social settings. My ability to manage my time effectively allows me to balance my studies and personal interests, ensuring I stay organized and focused. A fun fact about me is that I am naturally shy, but I become more playful and open as I build closer relationships. Although I might start off quiet, I’m friendly and approachable once you get to know me. I’m also a big K-pop fan, and I enjoy stanning groups like TWICE, LE SSERAFIM, and IVE. Music and culture are important to me, and I love sharing my interests with others!</p>
